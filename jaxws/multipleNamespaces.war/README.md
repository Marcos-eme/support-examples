##Multiple Namespaces

This is an example of an endpoint that has a WSDL that contains two target
namespaces in its `types` section, causing two `<schema>` elements to be
included in the WSDL.

There's also a client deployed on the server that will invoke the endpoint.

Use the `request.sh` to invoke the "client" endpoint.
